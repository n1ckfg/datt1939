An explanation of URLs
A web server is just somebody else's computerâ€”not fundamentally any different from your local machine.
You need to give the server a valid path leading to each file in order to find it, and this location may be different from the one on your machine.
This path is called the URL (Universal Resource Locator).
The three most popular operating systems in the world are Windows, Linux/Android, and MacOS/iOS.
Almost all webservers in the world run Linux.
Linux and Mac separate the folders in a path with a forward slash / while Windows does it with a backslash \ .
Linux is Case Sensitive and doesnt_allow_spaces_or_punctuation in file names, while neither of these are problems for Windows and Mac.
So the most common problems with URLs when you move files from Mac and Windows to a Linux web server are: forgetting to use / slashes, forgetting to keep things lower case, and forgetting to remove spaces and punctuation.
